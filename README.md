# Coquotes
Coquotes is a simple web page aimed to collect funny (or stupid) quotes told by my friends. 

The idea for this project came after spending four years with my friend Corentin aka Coco, who is the best source for stupid quotes.

Demo: http://quotes.opiumozor.com

## Usage

`./add_quotes.py "Coco" "Apple, Google and Facebook are startup companies."`

Add a new quote in the file quote_list.json. Then this file is parsed by the index.php and generate the web page.

## Requirements

 * Python 2.7
 * Php
 * Funny friends
